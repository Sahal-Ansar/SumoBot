# SumoBot

This project presents a straightforward yet innovative Arduino-based SumoBot, purpose-built for participation in sumo robot competitions. The SumoBot is thoughtfully engineered, incorporating a single ultrasonic sensor that serves as the primary tool for detecting obstacles and navigating its surroundings. This sensor plays a crucial role in the bot's functionality, enabling it to identify and react to opposing robots during matches.

The design features two strategically positioned wheels at the rear of the bot, which are responsible for its movement and agility within the competition arena. These rear-mounted wheels provide a balanced blend of speed and maneuverability, allowing the SumoBot to execute swift and precise movements during a match. The ultrasonic sensor, combined with the rear-wheel drive system, ensures that the bot is capable of effectively tracking and engaging opponents in the sumo ring.

This design is not only lightweight but also highly efficient, making it an ideal introductory project for those interested in exploring robotics. Whether you are a beginner or an enthusiast looking to build a functional and competitive sumo robot, this Arduino-based SumoBot offers a practical and rewarding experience. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it an excellent entry point into the world of robotics, providing both educational value and hands-on learning opportunities.
